 Assignment from Alexa. Cycle10

Alexa,
This is what I am turning in. I did it from scratch. It's not perfect, but it works. I plan on fixing it, by using a randon number generator to generate the luggage and fixing need the math so that the containers that can handle more weight are added more wieght. I added you as a collaborator to the repo. In case you would like to leave some comments. Please let me know what you think. Thank you.
